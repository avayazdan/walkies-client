## Walkies - Group Project

Deployed at:

This project was lovingly made by [Ava](https://github.com/avayazdan), [Claudia](https://github.com/claudiatmcp) and [Laura](https://github.com/laura-arch).

## Project Requirements

This project was built for project three of General Assembly's Full-Stack Software Engineering course. The project aim was to build our own API, utilise our growing knowledge of React as well as connecting backend to frontend for the first time. The project specs allowed us to take inspiration from complex websites/apps that use data such as AirBnb or Facebook and essentially rebuild it in our own way.

#### Project aim 

Walkies is a dog borrowing site, inspired by www.borrowmydoggy.com the functionality of Walkies includes:

### Planning

Our planning consisted of mostly discussing ideas and their potential caveats or benefits. Once we agreed on an idea, we researched other websites and their functionality and chose what we would like to implement in our own project. As shown above, we used Excalidraw to wireframe our project. This changed and was edite a few times during the first week, naturally as we progressed deeper into the project and realised potential flaws or caveats in our prior wireframe. 
A big part of our planning as well as process was using Trello for organisation and predicting our timeline. This helped tremendously with time management and awareness of what needs to be done next during our the process of building our project, from the very start to the very end!

#### Build

The project utilises React, HTML and CSS. As well as MongoDB, NPM and Mongoose. We used Insomnia and Postman to test our API's data and we stored our data on the MongoDB Atlas cloud at the end of week one. We started by building our backend/API together as a team, we utilised VScode LiveShare and we pushed to the same main branch during this week. During week two, we switched up our workflow, and started using our own Git branches, the reason for this was because on the frontend we split up individual tasks/components, whereas the backend was built together.
