But he‚Äôll do absolutely anything we ask of him, especially if there‚Äôs a treat involved. Emmett loves being the center of attention, loves meeting new people, loves going new places. Emmett is completely and utterly fearless. He tolerates what he doesn‚Äôt like ‚Äì puppies, not being fed on time ‚Äì with heavy sighs. But he‚Äôs happy, oh, is he happy. He wags his curly tail with his entire body. All he wants out of life is a good snuggle, a tasty snack, and a nice, long nap preferably outside, in the sun, on his back.</p>
